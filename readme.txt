Delete all or specific types of comments from your WordPress website, and optionally disable future comments with one click.

== Description ==
This plugin provides a page under Tools -> "WP Delete Comments" that:
1. Lets you delete all or specific types of existing comments (Approved, Pending, Spam, Trash).
2. Optionally disable future comments (so new posts wonâ€™t accept comments).

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `wp-delete-comments-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to Tools > WP Delete Comments to remove existing comments and/or disable future ones.

Simply uncheck the "Disable all future comments" box and submit again.
